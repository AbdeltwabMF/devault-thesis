We propose a \acrfull{dapp} that uses the \Gls{ethereum} \gls{smart contract}s for data access control and uses the \acrfull{ipfs} as a distributed system for storing and accessing data. Moreover, the files get encrypted on the client side using \acrshort{aes}-256-\acrshort{cbc} symmetric encryption and split into smaller chunks, distributed across multiple computers, and assigned a hash to allow users to locate them. Itâ€™s then served to the user via a peer-to-peer connection, similar to BitTorrent technology.

Our proposed solution overcomes the problem of the \gls{centralized} web, data censorship, data hacking, and data loss.
