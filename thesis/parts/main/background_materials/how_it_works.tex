\section{How Decentralized Cloud Storage Works}

Working of distributed or decentralized cloud storage is very simple. All the workers or participating users are connected over a P2P network and stores data in a very secure and decentralized way. The files are broken into small data chunks, and intelligently distributed across many of the nodes which are located globally with the help of blockchain technology.

The users who participate in renting their extra storage capacity are paid via cryptocurrency and end users who use this space also pay in cryptocurrency and upload their data. So, there is no centralized governing body, who is holding all the data.

There is complete privacy in transmitting and storing the data as no third party is involved in between and each participating node only stores encrypted fragments of user data which the only user has authority to manage it through their own public/private keys. So, now the user has full control over their data because of blockchain technology used.

This network is highly secure, faster and less expensive than the traditional cloud storage and thus soon going to overthrow traditional cloud storage systems.
