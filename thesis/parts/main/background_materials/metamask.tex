\section{Metamask, The Wallet Auth}

To transact on Ethereum, you need an account. There is no MySQL ``users'' table. There is no email/password login. \\[-8pt]

To create an Ethereum account, you need to set up a crypto wallet like Metamask. The wallet will be responsible for generating and securing your crypto keys for signing transactions. \\[-8pt]

Metamask generates your Private Key. You derive the Public Key from the Private Key. Your account's address is the last 20 bytes of a hashed Public Key. \\[-8pt]

The JS libraries will then connect to your Metamask wallet (if you permit them to do so), and they will ask you to sign Ethereum transactions. A decentralized application can't do anything without your signature.

Figure \ref{img:transactionFlowDig} show the transaction flow diagram.
