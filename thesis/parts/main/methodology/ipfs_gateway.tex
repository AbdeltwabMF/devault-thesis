\section{IPFS gateway}

IPFS deployment seeks to include native support of IPFS in all popular browsers and tools. Gateways provide workarounds for applications that do not yet support IPFS natively. For example, errors occur when a browser that does not support IPFS attempts access to IPFS content in the canonical form of ipfs://{CID}/{optional path to resource}. Other tools that rely solely on HTTP encounter similar errors in accessing IPFS content in canonical form, such as Curl (opens new window)and Wget (opens new window).

Tools like IPFS Companion (opens new window)resolve these content access errors. However, not every user has permission to alter — or be capable of altering — their computer configuration. IPFS gateways provide an HTTP-based service that allows IPFS-ignorant browsers and tools to access IPFS content.
