So far, we can upload files, download, share, delete, and search. The interface is pretty simple. If you are connected, it will show the account address and balance in the navbar. And you have been granted access to the vault tab. If not, you won't be able to access the vault tab.

Also, we could replace the public IPFS gateway with Filecoin. As for Filecoin, the availability, reliability, true decentralization,  privacy, and security are far more advanced than IPFS.
