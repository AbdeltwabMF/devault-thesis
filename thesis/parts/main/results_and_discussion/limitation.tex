\subsection{Limitation}

The limitations of our system are listed below: \\

\begin{itemize}
\item The user should have cryptocurrency to make transactions and to reward the entity for renting their hard disk, which is a constraint.
\item The user should install specific software such as metamask or brave wallet to use our system.
\item Cryptocurrencies are illegal in some countries, whereas our system needs those cryptocurrencies to work.
\item The uploading of a file may take a while because of the encryption and block mining, which is not practical.
\end{itemize}
