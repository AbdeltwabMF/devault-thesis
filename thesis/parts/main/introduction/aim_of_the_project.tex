\section{Aim of The Project}

The project aims to design and implement a \acrlong{dapp} that can store and retrieve files across the \gls{ipfs g} \gls{p2p g} network and uses the \Gls{blockchain} as a public database. However, the \acrlong{dapp} does not use traditional login. It uses a \gls{cryptocurrency} \gls{wallet}. Wallets give access to your funds and Ethereum applications. Only you should have access to your wallet. Moreover, we aimed to encrypt the files on the client side before uploading them so that it can prevent the data censorship and man in the middle attack.

On the other hand, the project aims to research cryptography, \gls{p2p g} networks, web technology, and Blockchain and to contribute to the active research on decentralized applications and cryptography.
