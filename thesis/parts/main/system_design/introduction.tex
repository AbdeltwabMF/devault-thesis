\section{Introduction}

% Design: if it is a software development project then give a high-level account of the structure of your software and how it works. What algorithms does it use? How do these compare with alternatives? What were the main design decisions you took, and their justifications? This is done in GP1.

% Implementation and testing: a detailed account of the implementation and testing of your software. Explain the conceptual structure of the algorithms. Also explain what data  structures  you  used,  and  how  the  algorithms  were  implemented.  What implementation decisions did you take, and why? There is no need to list every little function and procedure and explain its working in elaborate detail; use your judgment on what is appropriate to include. This is done in GP2.
