Data becomes one of the most valuable assets to everyone. Storing data in a secure and decentralized way nowadays is a tough challenge.
The big tech companies that provide the platform for storing the data have the right to edit, delete, modify, view, and analyze the content. Not to mention the data hacking, data loss, and the single point of failure, this is not a privacy-friendly platform.

Devault, unlike traditional cloud storage, has client-side encryption/decryption. Which prevents data censorship and man-in-the-middle attack. The decentralization nature of the blockchain and peer-to-peer networks make the devault even more secure and fast.

Remember, your data is yours. Do not let anyone take that from you.
